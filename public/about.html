<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I’m Taha Farrukh, a passionate and self-driven student of Computer Science at NED University with a growing expertise 
  in full-stack web and mobile development, artificial intelligence, and competitive programming. I believe in learning 
  by doing—whether it's through building real-world projects, contributing to tech competitions, or exploring new 
  frameworks and tools. My interests range from software engineering and AI to digital systems and user-centric design.</p>

<p>My journey in tech has been hands-on and curiosity-led. I’ve created projects spanning e-commerce websites, AI-powered 
  platforms, and personal finance applications, constantly experimenting and refining my skills in technologies 
  like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Flutter, Python, and C++. I'm currently diving deep into Data Structures & Algorithms 
  and preparing for ICPC to sharpen my problem-solving abilities. I’m also active in hackathons and university tech fests,
  where I enjoy working in teams and leading impactful solutions.</p>

<p>Beyond coding, I’m enthusiastic about content creation, mentoring others, and staying engaged on platforms like 
  LinkedIn to document and share my learning. My goal is to build tools and systems that solve real problems, help 
  people, and push the boundaries of innovation. I’m always open to collaboration and learning opportunities that 
  align with my vision of becoming a world-class software developer and AI innovator.</p>
